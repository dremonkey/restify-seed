Particle Restify Seed
=====================

This is a simple restify server seed with multiple environment configurations and yeoman/grunt integration. The main purpose of this is to serve as a server seed for other projects. Grunt tasks handle code validation and reloading on file changes.

### Features
- Grunt
- Configuration Files
- Colored terminal (console.log) output

### Configuration Files

Copy the config.example.js file => config.js and make changes as necessary. If you do not make a copy of this file, the first time you start up the server it will copy and create the config.js file for you.

### Getting Started

- Create your configuration file
- node server.js (or better yet nodemon server.js)
